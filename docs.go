// This package implements the DEJE Next protocol.
// For more information, read the docs below, or README.md.
//
// The front-facing API is fairly simple, and mostly consists
// of these top-level types, and model.Document. However, the
// better you understand the underlying technology, the more
// easily you will be able to integrate it into user-facing
// software, with a minimum of behavioral surprises or conceptual
// fog.
