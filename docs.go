// This package implements the DEJE Next protocol.
// For more information, read the docs below, or README.md.
//
// This software is currently in a round of refactoring, and
// as such, the API is *very* subject to change. You can expect
// it to become simpler in the next few weeks, such that it's
// fairly easy to create a new document or sync an existing one
// from the network, and pass all changes on to a UI.
